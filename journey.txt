Day 1 (17/03/2024):

Completed Project 1(Rock Paper Scissors).  
It was straight forward. Coding fundamentals were tested, but being familiar with coding alr it was easy for me to navigate through

Completed Project 2(Casino Number Guessing Game) as well. 
Relatively easy as well. Tried OOP in C++ for the first time.
Generating random number is a bit more complicated than in python but it was fine, got online documentation to guide through. Need to understand further on what the generator does though.

Day 2 (18/03/2024):
Completed Project 3(TextEditor).
I personally used QT and its documentation to complete this project. It was fun to learn a new library, defo made it wayy easier although learning it took me way longer than expected due to new concepts in C++ such as pointers. In the end QT kinda did most of the work so kinda a wasted project for me in terms of C++ goes. but got to lear a library.

Day 3, 4 (19/03/2024, 20/03/2024)
DID NO WORK, NOT AT HOME.

Day 5 (21/03/2024)
Started on Project 4(Minesweeper). 
Wasted quite a lot of time tryna set up SDL. Still did not work after 2 hours of tinkering around. 
Started working on the game logic instead and got halfway through until a bug stumped me. Tried working on it for about an hour. Got too tired to continue and went to Sleep.
Building this was quite similar to building Project 2, but wayy more game logic is requrired.

Day 6 (22/03/2024)
Continued working on Project 4(Minesweeper).
Got it working for cli after debugging for hours but having issues with SDL. Going to skip SDL for now to move on first. Will come back after Project 5.
Today had a better coding session. Broke down my bug line by line and went trhough my code for each case on my ipad. Realised i forgot to consider the edge case (HAISSSS).
Also spend 1hour debugging an error for edge case dodging. i wrote ```|| (x + j) ||``` instead of ```|| (x + j) > boardSize || ```. More wasted time. But great lesson learnt hahaha
